# we can install WSL on a non-system drive like the F drive. Here are the steps:

1. **Enable WSL:** Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable the WSL feature1:
```sh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```
2. **Create a directory:** Substitute the drive on which you want WSL to be installed if not F2. In PowerShell, set your location to the F drive and create a directory for the installation23:
```sh
Set-Location F:
New-Item WSL -Type Directory
Set-Location .\\WSL
```
3. **Download the appx package:** Find the URL of the distribution you want to install in this list2. For example, for Ubuntu 22.04, use this link. Now, download the appx package23:
```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2204 -OutFile Linux.appx -UseBasicParsing
```
4. **Unpack the package:** Make a backup and unpack23:
```sh
Copy-Item .\\Linux.appx .\\Linux.zip
Expand-Archive .\\Linux.zip
```
5. **Find and run the installer:** You should find a file named <distribution>.exe. Run that file, and the WSL distribution should be installed in the unpack folder of the other drive.
If you donâ€™t see an executable, look for an .appx file that was just unpacked, that is the flavor you want, and unzip that
```sh
Set-Location .\\Linux
Add-AppxPackage .\\Ubuntu_2204.1.7.0_x64.appx
```

# Now open the ubuntu from the shortcut added in the menu

**note:** `the wsl should be installed from microsoft store and Have the Virtual Machine Platform optional component enabled` [Click Here For Instructions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/#how-to-install-and-use-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store) 

6.enableing the systemd by opening wsl.conf file with nano:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
```
7.paste this and save by ctrl+s and ctrl+x
```sh
[boot]
systemd=true
```

# Now change the system hostname

8. navigate to host file and replacing the ip by name or other name by the name we required
```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
9.apply this and restart the terminal
```sh
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ubuntuWSL 
```
# we may face issue in connecting to lens

### Windows Preparation

1. Ensure hypervisor functionality is enabled in BIOS.
   * Otherwise you will hit https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5363
   *lets shut down the wsl
```
wsl --shutdown
```

2. Launch a PowerShell prompt in Administrator mode [Win+X > Windows PowerShell (Admin)]

```
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
```
3. Install the Linux kernel update package and install it
   * x86/x64 - https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi
   * arm64 - https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi

5. Restart machine

4. Launch a PowerShell prompt in Administrator mode [Win+X > Windows PowerShell (Admin)]

```
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

5. Install Ubuntu Linux distribution of your choice from the Windows Store (not the one with the version in the names)

6. Verify WSL version is set correctly

```
wsl --list --verbose
```
7.set the default wsl

```
wsl --setdefault Ubuntu
```
# now install everthing setp by step

1. install zsh shell, sudo for no password and open ssh --> `wsl-setup-automate.sh`
2. install docker using --> `docker-install`
3. install minikube using --> `mini-kube-install`
4. install kubectl using --> `kubectl-install`

# During ssh if we get anything like hostidentification changed
```
ssh-keygen -R 172.20.28.153
```

# certificate for private registry to solve dockers https request to http response error occured while connecting with local docker registry

## 1. get the node ip or minikube ip
```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
``` 
## 2. we need to generate a new certificate that includes the IP address 192.168.49.2(minikube ip) in the SAN field
```
   openssl req \
    -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout tls.key \
    -x509 -days 365 -out tls.crt \
    -subj "/CN=192.168.49.2" -extensions SAN \
    -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf \
        <(printf "\n[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=IP:192.168.49.2"))
```
## 3. create a folder in docker to store this https certificate which is generated by openssl to solve error certificate is not signed by trusted authority from docker
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/192.168.49.2:30085/
sudo cp /home/jaison/tls.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/192.168.49.2:30085/ca.cr
```
## 4. Now create base64 encoded of tls.crt & tls.key to paste in secret of private dockerregistry yaml
```
cat tls.crt | base64 | tr -d "\n" 
cat tls.key | base64 | tr -d "\n"
```
