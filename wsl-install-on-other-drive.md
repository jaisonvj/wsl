# we can install WSL on a non-system drive like the F drive. Here are the steps:

1. **Enable WSL:** Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable the WSL feature1:
```sh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```
2. **Create a directory:** Substitute the drive on which you want WSL to be installed if not F2. In PowerShell, set your location to the F drive and create a directory for the installation23:
```sh
Set-Location F:
New-Item WSL -Type Directory
Set-Location .\\WSL
```
3. **Download the appx package:** Find the URL of the distribution you want to install in this list2. For example, for Ubuntu 22.04, use this link. Now, download the appx package23:
```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2204 -OutFile Linux.appx -UseBasicParsing
```
4. **Unpack the package:** Make a backup and unpack23:
```sh
Copy-Item .\\Linux.appx .\\Linux.zip
Expand-Archive .\\Linux.zip
```
5. **Find and run the installer:** You should find a file named <distribution>.exe. Run that file, and the WSL distribution should be installed in the unpack folder of the other drive.
If you donâ€™t see an executable, look for an .appx file that was just unpacked, that is the flavor you want, and unzip that
```sh
Set-Location .\\Linux
Add-AppxPackage .\\Ubuntu_2204.1.7.0_x64.appx
```
