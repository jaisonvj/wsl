  ```sh
  ncrypted_pwd="my+secret+password"
  escaped_pwd="${encrypted_pwd//+/\\+}"                                              //${variable//pattern/replacement}

# connect to a MySQL server installed on Windows from WSL, you can follow these steps:

1. Install MySQL Client in WSL: You can install the MySQL client in WSL using the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install mysql-client-core-8.0
```

2. Find IPv4 Address of WSL: (windows) 
* Start Menu --> settings --> Network & Internet --> advanced network settings --> hardware and connection properties -->
* In the list that appears, look for an item named vEthernet (WSL). The IPv4 address listed there is what youâ€™ll use to connect to MySQL. eg: ipv4 address: 172.20.16.1/20

* **Knowlege note:** The IP address range 172.20.16.1/20 is a private IP address. It belongs to the private IP address space 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12). The IP address range 172.20.16.1/20 includes all IP addresses from 172.20.16.1 to 172.20.31.2543

3. execute below sql in sql cli: (Windows)
```sql
   CREATE USER 'root'@'172.20.28.153' IDENTIFIED BY 'rootroot'; --if error occus ok
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'172.20.28.153';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```


4.Connect to MySQL from WSL: Now try to connect to MySQL from WSL using the following command:
```ssh
mysql -h 172.20.16.1 -P 3306 -u root -p

```

# To check number of tables in zenoptics you can execute below command

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'zenoptics';
```
